# Heart_prediction_failure
A heart failure clinical records dataset was analyzed for this project. The process began with exploratory data analysis, followed by feature engineering on the dataset. Multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, KNN, and ensemble models, were implemented and compared to determine the best model. Azure AutoML was also used for comparison as a benchmark.
